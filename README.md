# Ear-print-Biometrics

🧠 Ear Print Biometrics

A research and development project focused on ear-based biometric identification, leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques to recognize individuals using the unique structure of the human ear.

📘 Overview

Biometric systems use unique physiological traits for identity verification.
While fingerprints, iris scans, and facial recognition are common, ear biometrics offer several advantages:

  Stable over time (ears don’t change significantly with age)

  Less invasive and easier to capture

  Robust against facial expressions and disguises

This project explores ear image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification to develop an accurate and efficient ear recognition system.
